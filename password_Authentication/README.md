**Simple Password Verification (Disclaimer: Not production-ready)

This code implements a basic password verification flow with attempts and basic error handling. This is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments due to security concerns.

Features:

Asks the user to create and confirm a password.
Provides three attempts to enter the correct password.
Offers limited feedback on password correctness and remaining attempts.
Security Concerns:

Critical: Stores passwords in plain text. Never do this in production! Use secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2id.
Limited attempt protection (3 attempts might be insufficient).
Improvements Needed:

Implement secure password hashing.
Enhance error handling for various input scenarios.
Provide more informative user feedback, including password strength suggestions and potential reset options.
Consider alternative input methods for passwords beyond input function for better security.
Remove unnecessary string manipulations like uppercasing messages.
Disclaimer:

This code is provided as a basic example and is not suitable for production use. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices when handling passwords.
